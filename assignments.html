                    <h2>Assignment 1: Prototype</h2>
                    <p>The first prototype that we were tasked to do was to make a phone stand out of cardboard and at the sane time ensure that it is collpasable to make it more conveneient for the user to bring around<br> The following are the steps I took to make the final product. <br> <br>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design and sketch the idea out onto a piece of paper 
                    <br> note: sketched on phone first because i had no paper on hand but later transferred design to a paper. <br> <br>
                    <img src="under contruction.jpg" width=120px height = 160px alt><br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2:</b> search for suitable cardboard to create the prototype 
                    <br> note: ensure that it is not too hard so that it would be easy to cut into and ensure that it is not too soft so that it can support the phone. <br> <br>
                    <img src="under contruction.jpg" width=120px height = 160px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> make an outline on the selected carboard to use as guide to cut in the the next step <br> <br>

                    <b> STEP 4: </b> follow the guide drawn in the earlier step and cut out the shape <br><br>
                    <img src="under contruction.jpg" width=120px height = 160px alt> <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> assemble the prototype by joining the two pieces and test it out with a phone!! <br> <br>

                    <h2>Assignment 3: Web development</h2>
                    <p>The third assignment that we were tasked to do was to follow a tutorial by Jake Wright and duplicate his work to create a similar site.  <br> <br> </p>

                    <p> <br> </p>
                    <h2>Assignment 4: Computer Aided design</h2>
                    <p>The design that we were tasked to do was to make a keyring as well as a fidget spinner.<br> The following are the steps I took to make the final product. <br> <br>
                    <h3>Key Ring</h3>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design that you would like to use and sketch it on a piece of paper <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2:</b> create a sketch on fusion360 and sketch a rectangle to start off the whole design. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> draw a circle with the centrepoint being the midpoint of the top of the rectangle. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> trim the line at the top of the rectangle and the bottom of the circle to create one part of the keyring. Next, i selected the offset button and selected the the semicircle plus rectangle to offset the figure by negative 2mm to bring it outside instead of inside. <br><br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> add a circle at the top of the figure and ensure that the bottom of the circle touches the curve of the inner figure and offset the circle by negative 2mm to bring it inside instead of outside. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> trim off the bottom part of the bigger circle and the curve of the bigger figure where it intersects.  <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> design a heart using circles and lines and i added it to the middle of the keyring that i have designed in the previous steps. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 8: </b> fillet the bottom parts of the keyring by 2mm to make it curved and safer for the user. fillet both the inside figure and outside figure to make it look symmetrical. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 9: </b> click 'finish sketch' and extrude the figure by 2mm and this is how my key ring looks like!! <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>

                    <h3>Fidget Spinner</h3>
                    <b>STEP 1:</b> think of a design and sketch the idea out onto a piece of paper. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2:</b> create a sketch on Fusion360 and sketch 4 circles to start off. Then create an offset for each circle at 2mm. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> i used the 'fit point spline' to create the curves of the fidget spinner <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 4: </b> using 'line', i connected parts of the fidget spinner that were not connected and lastly i extruded the diagram by 3mm and this is how my fidget spinner looks like like!! <br> <br>
                    insert a picture </p>

                    <p> <br> </p>
                    <h2>Assignment 5: 3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>The fifth assignment that we were tasked to do was to create a chess peice using Fusion360. The head of the chess piece was to be extruded and the base, revolution. The following were the steps i took to get my finished product <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 1: </b> search online for an outline of the chess piece and download it <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 2: </b> insert the outline of the downloaded chess piece in the form of a canvas <br> <br> 
                    insert a picture <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> enter sketch mode and use the 'line' function to create a rough outline of the chess piece. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 3: </b> measure the height and width of the chess piece to ensure that it is of the appropriate size and click 'finish sketch'. Follow by extruding the head piece of the chess piece, for me i used 3mm. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 5: </b> next, i created an outline for half of the base piece and ensured that it was more or less centralised, after i exited the sketch mode. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 6: </b> after exiting sketch mode, i then used revolution on the base piece to suit the type 'full'. After, i saved the project as an STL file  <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 7: </b> i opened Cura and selected Ultimaker 2+ as the 3D printer with PLA filament. i then uploaded the chess piece into Cura and tuned the settings to ensure that i could print the chess piece within 45 minutes. <br> <br>
                    insert a picture <br> <br> 
                    <b> STEP 8: </b> i added the gcode file into the sd card of the ultimaker 2+ to upload my design into the 3D printing machine. After selecting my design, i sent it for printing and began the waiting process. <br> <br>
                    <b> STEP 9: </b> After waiting about 20 minutes, my chess piece was ready to be removed and i had my very own chess piece made by me!
